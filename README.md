# Scripts

This repository contains scripts that I consider useful and worth keeping around.

## Highlights

- `Ansible` directory contains its own README.
- `Bash/template.sh` is a template for bash scripts.
- `Bash/generalize_simple.sh` some simple steps to generalize a virtual machine or container.
- `LXD/k-playground.sh` builds, shows and destroys a [LXD Playground for Kubernetes](https://calinradoni.github.io/pages/230918-lxd-playground-for-k8s.html). The linked article contains the basic steps. The script is the practical, scripted, implementation.
- `LXD/a-playground.sh` builds, shows and destroys an Ansible playground. The containers can be accessed from the host by name.
- `web/randomLettersFX.ts`.
- `Astro` directory is for `Astro` and `Starlight` development and contains its own README.
